# html2epub
XProc libraries to convert EPUB from XHTML5

The input file format of the converter should be a .html, .xhtml or a zip.

Using a zip allows to include assets: a stylesheet, images, fonts, etc. The zip needs to contain one HTML file, that needs to have the same name as the zip file (i.e., in `my-awesome.zip` include at least `my-awesome.html`.)

## Installation

The required dependencies are includes as submodules. After cloning this repository, in the terminal, run:

   git submodule update --init --recursive

## Example usage

From the html2epub folder, in the terminal, run:

    make conversion IN_FILE=/path/to/zip_file.zip

The files will be created in the `output` folder of html2epub.

## Web interface

You can also use the web interface. Open `frontend_example.html`. It connects to the le-tex server, where an install of this library is hosted. In this way you can use the interface of the browser and you donâ€™t need to install libraries on your own computer. To download the files, you need the credentials: you can find them in the source of the html file.
